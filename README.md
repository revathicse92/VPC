# VPC
#What is vpc?
   #A VPC is a logically isolated section of the cloud where you can launch your resources and applications. It acts as a virtual network, allowing you to control access to your resources and manage the flow of data between them. VPCs provide the ability to host multiple isolated networks in the same cloud region, each with its own IP address space, routing tables, security groups, and network gateways.
